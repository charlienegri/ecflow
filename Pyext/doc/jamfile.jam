# Use of <dll-path> should force a relink. But this *ONLY* works for executables
# and *NOT* shared libraries. The HACKY work around is use <dll-path> when 
# building the extension. Hence this requires that ECFLOW_INSTALL_DIR 
# is correctly set during build time. Yuk.

# ===================== project settings =================================
# Set up the project-wide requirements that everything uses the
# boost_python library from the project whose global ID is /boost/python.
#
# AIX: need to add additional include for pyconfig.hpp since we have 
#      one for python32 and another one for python64. 
#      (Typically there is only _one_ in  the python includes dir)
#      *** This should have been added to site-config.jam file **
#
# AIX: we get TOC overflow, because compiler/linker has 64k limit on
#      the number of global symbols. Options are use:
#       0/ Break up shared lib
#       1/ -bbigtoc to overcome at the cost of performance degradation
#       2/ --qipa=level=0 if this fails try
#       3/ --qipa=level=1 if this fails try
#       4/ --qipa=level=2 if this fails, revert to -bbigtoc
#       Currently option 2-4 didn't work!
#      *** This should have been added to site-config.jam file **
#      prevously we had:   : requirements <toolset>vacpp:<linkflags>-bbigtoc  
#
#  If we use:
#  : requirements <library>/boost/python//boost_python 
#       THEN we will depend on $BOOST_ROOT/bin.v2/...
#       This will be automatically compiled if it does not exist
#  : requirements <library>/site-config//boost_python
#       THEN use the boost python in $BOOST_ROOT/stage/lib/
#       This is also expects  we have defined boost_python in site-config.jam/user-config.jam
#

# ======================== libs ============================================
# HPUX:  ADD standard libs. They don't get added by default ?
#        Also on HPUX the shared libs appears reversed, and don't appear
#        in the order specified weird ?
#        Notice the use of <library> to add additional library on the link line
#        but only for HPUX/acc toolset
# <ALL>: It appears the pthread lib is automatically added. i.e >lib pthread ;
#
# Note:  <toolset>vacpp:<linkflags>-bbigtoc  was required for 
#            ecgate(rs6000) ONLY and not c1b(ibm_power6)

# <dll-path> specify the path which will be used at runtime to search for dynamic libraries
# it is like using rpath, i.e. to hard code a directory, when doing a runtime search for a library
# <dll-path>$(ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR), is used, to dynamically load boost-python shared library
# Requested by User Support, to avoid having user add LD_LIBRARY_PATH to their environment
#
# *HOWEVER* this does not work at install time, and must be done at link time. See below
#
# The tests(run-test) *BELOW* specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH and hence override <dll-path>
# 
# Linux: ldd <extension>
#           If the embedded object is not accessible, it just shows "=>not found"
#           In our case the boost python shared lib may not exist until added at install time.
#           *** Hence ldd can be very misleading ***
#           *** Also if LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set *and* path exist, this will be shown & hence hide embedded paths ***
#
#        objdump -p  <extension>     // detailed dump, *SHOWS* the embedded paths, and search order
#           shared library dynamic path search:
#              LD_LIBRARY_PATH    enabled  first
#              embedded path      enabled  second   
#
# HPUX:  ldd <extension>
#        chatr <extension>           // detailed dump, *SHOWS* search path and embedded path
#           shared library dynamic path search:
#              LD_LIBRARY_PATH    enabled  first
#              SHLIB_PATH         enabled  second
#              embedded path      enabled  third   
#
# AIX:  ldd  <extension>
#       dump -H <extension>
#
# NOTE: <linkflags>-L$(ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR)
#       <dll-path>$(ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR)
#      is ONLY required during install. 
#      However install does not appear to force a relink. 
#      The bjam documentations suggests that <dll-path> is only required at install. 
#      But that does not work, since we don't appear to relink. It *ONLY* works with exe's and not shared libs
#      As a result tried to use <dll-path> at link time, with mixed results:
#             hardcode-dll-paths    install                          link
#      Linux:  does not work,       <dll-path> does not work         <dll-path> works
#      HPUX:   works                <dll-path> does not work         <dll-path> does not work
#                                                                    adding -L/path added, but get ignored by -L 
#                                                                    allready there on development path 
#      AIX:    does not work        <dll-path> does not work         <dll-path> does not work
#                                                                    -L/path however does
# Bjam documentation suggest hardcode-dll-paths has a default value of true,
# this however can only be seen on HPUX. Tried combination of:
#     <toolset>acc:<hardcode-dll-paths>false
#     <toolset>acc:<linkflags>-L$(ECFLOW_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR)
# Again no effect:
#
# Tried using:  bjam install-py dll-path=/var/tmp/ma0/ecflow/1.9.15/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ecflow -d2
# This will ONLY work if the extension needs building, will not work for installing as emos
# as emos will not have permission to write into workspace first.
