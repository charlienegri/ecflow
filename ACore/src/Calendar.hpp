// Description : The calendar object is initialised when the suite begins.
//               The calendar encapsulates date and time. The date is derived from the time.
//
// After each update the calendar will store the time_duration between the init() function
// call and the update() function call.
// The calendar is to be used for all reference to time and date
// This will stop different time functionality from getting out of step.
//
// Examples of Use of calendar are:
//    o Generated time variables
//    o Time dependent attributes: TimeAttr,TodaySeries,CronAttr,DateAttr,DayAttr
//      ****************************************************************************
//      ** A time attribute can have a +, which means time relative to suite start
//      ** This is stored on the TimeSeries, as it isNode/Attribute specific.
//      ** i.e repeated families will have its own relative start time.
//      *****************************************************************************
//
// DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
//   Real and Hybrid:
//   Real
//      calendar is like a normal calendar where time and date are related
//      and day/date changes at midnight.
//   Hybrid:
//      There is currently confusion about how this is supposed to work.
//      The date is not supposed to change. (According to John date updates at suite restart?)
//      This has important implications, i.e does the day change ?
//      If the day does not change, then many of suites will never complete.
//      	i.e if we use repeat, with a single time series,  "time 10:00"
//      *** This relies on a day change to reset time attribute at midnight. ****
//   Conclusion: Will support day change for both REAL and HYBRID (date does not change)
//
// Calendar Updates:
// 	 How and when should we update the calendar?
//   In both the approaches below we need to make a distinction/separation
//   between the server poll and calendar update. This is required for testing
//
//	o Poll/Job submission interval in server is used to update calendar .
//     +: No time slots will be missed. even if server is suspended/restarted.
//        since suspending the server, also suspends the calendar updates
//     +: Suite relative times will continue to work even after server stopped/started
//     +: Avoids additional system call.
//     +: Lead's to more deterministic behaviour
//     -: If server is suspended and restarted the calendar will NOT be in
//        phase with system clock. (Its not clear to me why this should be an issue?)
//     ?: If the server is run for several days is there a possibility for the poll
//        update to get out of skew with real time. This is only possible if
//        job dependencies take more the 60 seconds to resolve.
//      *** THIS FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS TO BE ADVERTISED, SO THAT USERS ARE AWARE OF IT
//      *** THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS AVAILABLE VIA -s flag on the clock attribute .i.e
//      *** the -s stand's for stop start clock in line with the server
// 	        clock real 20.1.2007 +01:00 -s
// 			clock hybrid -s
//
//	o Poll/Job submission interval in server is used Initiate an update of calendar via a system call.
//     +: calendar is always in phase with system clock.
//        Many task job dependencies depend on ordering based on real time.
//     -: Requires additional system call for each poll in the server
//     -: Time slots can be missed. (i.e if server suspended/restarted).
//        There is no catch up. (?? See TimeDependencies.ddoc)
//     -: Relative times will not be adhered too, when server stopped/started.
//     -: Will require more manual intervention ?
//
//  Conclusion:: The clock attribute will be changed to add both capabilities
//
//  Resolution: Will support 1 minute resolution:

	//	rules at will.
	//	If you want to handle wall-clock times in the future, you won't be able (in the general case) to calculate exact durations,
	//	for the same reasons described above.
	//	If you want accurate calculations with future times, you will have to use TAI or an equivalent, but the mapping from
	//	TAI to UTC or local time depends on leap seconds, so you will not have exact agreement with wall-clock time.
